# Activate-PowerScheme

This PowerShell script allows you to quickly switch between power schemes (plans) in Windows. Unlike the `powercfg.exe` util, the script takes the name of a scheme, not the UUID.

## Usage

```
> activate-powerscheme -scheme Balanced
SUCCESS: Power scheme 'Balanced' is activated successfully.
```
